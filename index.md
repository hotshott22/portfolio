## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Prashik.png">

Hi! I am Prashik, a student at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay currently completing a masters student at the Department of Energy Science and Engineering. I've had stints with competetive programming and software development.  

Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* Working on a cool web service. More coming soon!

* Developing methods to train and infer from extremely deep and sparse neural networks while preserving performance. 

* Life?


## Past

* **University Of Wisconsin - Madison**	
	

Under the mentorship of Prof. Ive Hermans, our project harnessed machine learning to revolutionize the screening of chemical compounds, achieving a remarkable 70% reduction in processing time. We meticulously curated a comprehensive dataset, encompassing over 50 features of catalysts, derived from an extensive review of more than 200 research papers. Utilizing SQL, we adeptly cleaned and filtered the raw data, ensuring precision and reliability. This innovative approach not only accelerated the research process but also set a new benchmark in the field of chemical compound analysis.


* **ZS Associates**	
##### Associate

In my role as an Associate, I collaborated with the Data Engineering team to enhance the performance of AWS frameworks, achieving a 60% reduction in processing time. Additionally, I developed Data Quality Management services and conducted a proof of concept (POC) to minimize the cost of cloud resources used in these frameworks. This experience not only optimized system efficiency but also demonstrated significant cost savings in cloud resource management.


* **Indian School of Business	Hyderabad**
* Research Assistant
  
• Worked with Prof. Sumeet Kumar on the project “YouTube Parental Control”, developed a kids friendly Android app. 

• Developed a YT video transcript database to segregate educationally rich content based on sentiment analysis.


* **Indian Institutes of Management Udaipur**	
* Research Assistant
  
• Worked under Prof. Ashish Galande on project “Effect of social distancing promotion campaigns on brand value”.

• Used POS tagging, Regex, beautifulSoup, and other NLP techniques for sentiment analysis of twitter data to understand the brand. 


## Future


* Graduate?

* More research?

* ...

## Random

* Whiteboards help me think better. The bigger, the better. 

* I love going out for trips and exploring different cultures/environments!

* Indian Food > All other cuisines. Please change my mind. 

* Mohammed Rafi > any other singer. 


## Publications

Hopefully coming soon!
