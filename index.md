## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Prashik22.png">

Hi! I am Prashik, a student at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay currently completing my masters degree. I am passionate about computer science and its applications in chemistry, with a particular focus on using machine learning to aid catalyst discovery. You can often find me in one of the labs at the IIT Bombay CSE Department, where I engage in discussions and collaborate on innovative projects in this exciting field.


Apart from this, I've had stints with competetive programming and software development.  


Hit me up if you've got a cool idea regarding any of those and wish to collaborate!

## Present

* I work with catalysts and machine learning. I guess you could say Iâ€™m all about fast reactions and smart predictions!

* I like reading history about the Crusades, uncovering the epic battles, complex politics, and cultural exchanges of this pivotal era.

* Life?


## Past

* **University Of Wisconsin - Madison**	
	

Under the mentorship of **Prof. Ive Hermans**, our project harnessed machine learning to revolutionize the screening of chemical compounds, achieving a remarkable 70% reduction in processing time. We meticulously curated a comprehensive dataset, encompassing over 50 features of catalysts, derived from an extensive review of more than 200 research papers. Utilizing SQL, we adeptly cleaned and filtered the raw data, ensuring precision and reliability. This innovative approach not only accelerated the research process but also set a new benchmark in the field of chemical compound analysis.


* **ZS Associates**	

In my role as an Associate, I collaborated with the Data Engineering team to enhance the performance of AWS frameworks, achieving a 60% reduction in processing time. Additionally, I developed Data Quality Management services and conducted a proof of concept (POC) to minimize the cost of cloud resources used in these frameworks. This experience not only optimized system efficiency but also demonstrated significant cost savings in cloud resource management.


* **Indian School of Business	Hyderabad**

As a Research Assistant, I collaborated with **Prof. Sumeet Kumar** on the "YouTube Parental Control" project, developing a kid-friendly Android app. I also created a YouTube video transcript database to segregate educationally rich content through sentiment analysis, ensuring a safe and enriching viewing experience for children.


* **Indian Institutes of Management Udaipur**
  
As a Research Assistant under **Prof. Ashish Galande**, I contributed to the project "Effect of Social Distancing Promotion Campaigns on Brand Value." I utilized POS tagging, Regex, BeautifulSoup, and other NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, providing valuable insights into the impact of these campaigns on brand perception.



## Future


* Graduate?

* More research?

* By day, I'm an energy systems guru wielding a spatula like a culinary crusader. Mastering the grid is my ultimate goal, but if all else fails, I'll settle for opening a killer sandwich joint in Mumbai!


## Random

* Whiteboards help me think better. The bigger, the better. 

* I'm a data scientist by day, a chemist by night. (And sometimes, both at the same time.) But I'm not sure if I'm stable enough to handle both.
  
* Alongside debugging code and optimizing algorithms, I take pride in my ability to cook delicious homemade meals.

* Indian Food > All other cuisines. Please change my mind. 

* Mohammed Rafi > any other singer.
